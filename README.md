## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

- 

### Screenshot


![](./images/screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

Still developing a "process." However I blcoked most of what I need in html and css first. Then I added the javascript in slowly building the fetch request. I followed the request with a lot of console.log() to see how the data was being handled.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

First code attempt with Javascript. I'm sure I could write my renderAdvice() function cleaner. On my first attempt I was able to fetch the JSON from the URL and extract the string from the object.

The next step is to be able to load a quote when the website loads and then fetch a new quote when the button registers a click event.

### Continued development

I'd like to be able to write this code with some more elegance and less redundancy. I'm will to bet with some practice I could cut the renderAdvice function in half.
